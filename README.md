CS128H project

Group: Ayush (akhot2), Jason (jasonoh3), Luke (lukep2), Sam (samuel37)


Project Introduction: Our goal for this project is to build a decentralized blockchain for managing personal information in a hospital setting. If we have further time, we can implement a machine learning algorithm to find patterns in age and health for certain medical issues, such as high blood pressure. We've chosen to work on this project because it's a large area of research and may prove useful in identifying patterns in health while making sure personal information isn't public.


Technical Overview: 


 - Create HashMap and data structure for holding information.

 - Implement Nonce, Hash, and Node to build blockchain
 
 Checkpoint 1
 
 - Use existing "dummy" personal information from Hospital data to simulate decentralized blockchain in-use
 
 - Implement ML on blockchain to learn patterns without accessesing personal data (if time allows) (construct dataloader before Checkpoint 2)
 

Possible Challenges:

 - Creating HashMap that doesn't conflict and have multiple "ids"
 
 - Using new blockchain and ML packages in Rust

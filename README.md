Project Introduction: Our goal for this project is to build a decentralized blockchain for managing personal information in a hospital setting. If we have further time, we can implement a logistic regression algorithm to find patterns in death based on sex, age, pre-existing conditions, and other health factors. We've chosen to work on this project because it's a large area of research and may prove useful in identifying patterns in health while making sure personal information isn't public.


Technical Overview: 


 - Create blockchain data structure for holding information.

 - Implement logistic regression algorithm to predict death from patient health
 
 Checkpoint 1
 
 - Use existing "dummy" personal information from Hospital data to simulate decentralized blockchain in-use
 
 - Implement ML on blockchain to learn patterns in death using patient health information
 

Possible Challenges:

 - Creating blockchain that doesn't conflict and has multiple ids and hash iterations
 
 - Creating blockchain and logistic regression algorithms in Rust
